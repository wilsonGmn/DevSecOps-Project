<tr><td>Bypassing 403</td><td>Bypassing 403 endpoints may be possible, the scan rule sent a payload that caused the response to be accessible (status code 200).</td><td>Medium</td><td></td><td>null</td></tr>
<tr><td>Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set</td><td>Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page â€” covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.</td><td>Medium</td><td></td><td>null</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sub Resource Integrity Attribute Missing</td><td>The integrity attribute is missing on a script or link tag served by an external server. The integrity tag prevents an attacker who have gained access to this server from injecting a malicious content.</td><td>Medium</td><td></td><td>null</td></tr>

<tr><td>In Page Banner Information Leak</td><td>The server returned a version banner string in the response content. Such information leaks may allow attackers to further target specific issues impacting the product and version in use.</td><td>Low</td><td></td><td>null</td></tr>
<tr><td>X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing</td><td>The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.</td><td>Low</td><td></td><td>null</td></tr>
