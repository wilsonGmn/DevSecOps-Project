<tr><td>Use of cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)</td><td>This rule identifies use of cryptographically weak random number generators.
Using cryptographically weak random number generators like `crypto.pseudoRandomBytes()` 
and `Math.random()` for security-critical tasks can expose systems to significant 
vulnerabilities. Attackers might predict the generated random numbers, compromising 
the integrity and confidentiality of cryptographic operations. This could lead to 
breaches where sensitive data is accessed or manipulated, authentication mechanisms 
are bypassed, or secure communications are intercepted, ultimately undermining the 
security of the entire system or application.

Mitigation strategy:
Replace the use of these cryptographically weak random number generators with 
`crypto.randomBytes()`, a method provided by Node.js's `crypto` module that 
generates cryptographically secure random numbers. This method should be used 
for all operations requiring secure randomness, such as generating keys, tokens, 
or any cryptographic material.

Secure Code Example:
```
const crypto = require('crypto');
const secureBytes = crypto.randomBytes(256);
console.log(`Secure random bytes: ${secureBytes.toString('hex')}`);
```
